## Print functions 
print('First Program - Python print function')
print("It is declared like this:")
print('print("what to print..?")')

## instead of printing these many lines we can print every thing in 1 line which is called as string concatination...

print("Hello World\n Hello World\n Hellow World") ## prints one line after another.. Here we arae creating new lines using \n 

print("Hello" + "Pilot") ### this gives output as HelloPilot with no space 

## to get space we have to use like this 
print("Hello" + " " + "Pilot") ## this gives output as Hello Pilot

# Input Functions ## general syntax: input(prompt)  
input("what is your name?")

## by using print statement ( nested with print function)
print("Hello" + " " + input("what is your name?"))

#### to print the name 
input("what is your name?" + " ")
print("Hey " + "  " + input("what is your name?")+ "," + "How are you?")
